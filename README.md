# Nested Random Number Generator 
Implementation of ISSN: 2277 128X and DOI: 10.23956/ijarcsse/SV7I5/0327 article in Python 3.8, uses PIL and time libs.

Implementation could be better (just use Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate primes, not this shit I wrote) - still tho it's quite fast (generates 100k random numbers in less than a second, 100 milion in about 230secs).
